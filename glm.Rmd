#1 Prepare the data. For every minute of the match we want 1) goal home or goal away in that minute? 2) state of the match (current result and players on  the field for both teams).

#Sanity check, no more of one goal per minute
all(statsr$home_goal_now %in% c(0, 1)) && all(statsr$away_goal_now %in% c(0, 1))

#From the home team perspective
statsr$score_state <- statsr$home_goals - statsr$away_goals
statsr$player_advantage_state <- statsr$red_cards_away - statsr$red_cards_home

# 1. From `dataco`, select only the match_id and the pre-match expected goals.
pre_match_strengths <- dataco[, .(match_id, expH, expA)]

# 2. Merge these strengths into your state_data dataframe.
# The `merge` function will use the common column `match_id` to align the data correctly.
# It will automatically repeat the expH and expA values for every minute of each match.
state_data_full <- merge(state_data, pre_match_strengths, by = "match_id")

# 3. (Optional but recommended) Set the order for readability.
