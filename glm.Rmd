################### Final Data preparation #########################################################
#1 Prepare the data. For every minute of the match we want 1) goal home or goal away in that minute? 2) state of the match (current result and players on  the field for both teams).

#Sanity check, no more of one goal per minute
all(statsr$home_goal_now %in% c(0, 1)) && all(statsr$away_goal_now %in% c(0, 1))

#From the home team perspective
statsr$score_state <- statsr$home_goals - statsr$away_goals
statsr$player_advantage_state <- statsr$red_cards_away - statsr$red_cards_home

state_data <- statsr[, c("match_id", 
                     "minute", 
                     "home_goal_now", 
                     "away_goal_now", 
                     "score_state", 
                     "player_advantage_state")]

# 1. From `dataco`, select only the match_id and the pre-match expected goals.
pre_match_strengths <- dataco[, .(match_id, expH, expA)]

# 2. Merge these strengths into your state_data dataframe.
# The `merge` function will use the common column `match_id` to align the data correctly.
# It will automatically repeat the expH and expA values for every minute of each match.
state_data_full <- merge(state_data, pre_match_strengths, by = "match_id")

# 3. (Optional but recommended) Set the order for readability.
setorder(state_data_full, match_id, minute)


# 1. Create the 'home' perspective dataframe

# 2. Create the 'away' perspective dataframe
away_df <- state_data_full[, .(
  match_id,
  minute,
  team = "away",
  goal_scored = away_goal_now,
  # Predictors from the away team's perspective (signs are flipped)

  player_diff = -player_advantage_state, # becomes (home_reds - away_reds)
  own_expG = expA,
  opponent_expG = expH
)]


# 3. Combine the two dataframes into one long format
model_data <- rbind(home_df, away_df)
